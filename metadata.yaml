description: "One of Cleopatra's Nights and Other Fantastic Romances is a collection\
  \ of fantasy short stories by Théophile Gautier, selected from his Nouvelles and\
  \ Romans et Contes and translated from the French by Lafcadio Hearn. The translation\
  \ was Hearn's first book, and is considered one of the best English translations\
  \ of Gautier. It was first published in hardcover by Richard Worthington in 1882,\
  \ and reprinted in 1886, 1888, 1890 and 1891; later reprint editions were issued\
  \ by H. W. Hagemann (1894) and Brentano's in 1899, 1900, 1906, 1910, 1915, and 1927.\
  \ The first British edition was published by MacLaren and Co. in 1907. The book\
  \ was reprinted as a trade paperback by Wildside Press in 1999.\nLin Carter intended\
  \ to reissue the collection as a volume in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series,\
  \ though this hope was not realized.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
